Get images using COCO API - Done
Write a train function
Get a pre-trained CNN and connect it to an LSTM Network
Figure out how to offload all these to the small GPUs in ieng

- add attention LSTM model
- experiment with number of layers
- experiment with Flickr
- experiment with attention vs no-attention
